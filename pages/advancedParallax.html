        <h3>Adjusted Scroll parallax</h3>
        <p>In this effect we adjust the speed of different objects
            The scroll on the headline is going doing and the stones
            in the bottom of the screen are scrolling up showing more
            the further the scroll.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scroll amount that is scrolled from the top of 
            the wondow is pulled via Jquery using: 
        </p>
        <p>
            $(window).scroll(function(){
        <br>
            let Scroll = $(this).scrollTop()
            <br>
            };             
        </p>
        <p>
            This produces a value which we can transform the
            position of selected elements.
            the transform: translateX() here is an obvious candidate;
            but other effects such as opacity can be used. like on the title of this page.
