            <h1>Basic Parallax Effect</h1>
            <p>
                This basic parallax scrolling is a pure css "trick" in which the background properties has
                been set to <b>attachment: fixed</b>. 
                this makes the background not scroll but stay in place while the rest of the page scrolls over it. 
                Important steps is the framing of the background. so that it remains static.

            </p>
            <p>
                The fixed navigation is an important part of the experience.
                It should stay fixed to make the parallax feeling more apparent.

            <p> this effect is similar to the above but the use of negative space is promenent</p>
            <p>it is however important that the natural flow of the image, where the eye will naturaly move
                follows the scroll. Here it should be from bot to top.
