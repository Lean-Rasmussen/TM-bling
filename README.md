TM bling:

This project is a css and less desing site, to test some CSS techniques and show them. Feel free to take any code parts. 

Less will be divided up into the 7-1 sass structure. 
Introductions and guides which I have build will be linked here under the relevant section. 


The different views are put into the folder pages.

Here the HTML for the different views including the front page and parallax page etc.

--Frontpage is a just a starting view.
